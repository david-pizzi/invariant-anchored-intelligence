# Non-Goals

This project explicitly does **not** aim to:

- design or promote global AI governance systems,
- induce or accelerate full technological singularity,
- create AI systems with sovereignty over truth or success criteria,
- replace human decision-making entirely,
- encode human morality, ethics, or values into AI,
- claim inevitability of any technological trajectory.

---

## Scope Clarification

The project is intentionally:
- local rather than planetary,
- experimental rather than prescriptive,
- empirical rather than speculative.

Any discussion of global outcomes or existential risk is considered **out of scope**
for the purposes of design and proof of concept.
