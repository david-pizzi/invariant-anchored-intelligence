# Invariant Challenge Loop — Parameter Suggestion Extension

This document specifies an extension to the Invariant Challenge Loop (ICL) whereby
the system may *suggest* changes to internal optimisation parameters (e.g. `epsilon`,
`iai_gamma`) **without autonomously applying them**.

This mechanism enables bounded, auditable self-improvement while preserving
external authority over all changes.

---

## 1. Purpose

The goal of this extension is to allow the system to surface *evidence-based
recommendations* about its own internal configuration, while maintaining strict
separation between:

- optimisation
- evaluation
- authority

The system may identify patterns indicating over-exploration, under-exploration,
or instability, and may propose parameter adjustments accordingly.  
All such proposals are advisory only.

---

## 2. Scope and Non-Goals

### In scope
- Suggesting directional adjustments to internal parameters such as:
  - `epsilon` (ε-greedy exploration rate)
  - `iai_gamma` (IAI selector exploration rate)
- Grounding suggestions in observable strain signals
- Emitting proposals as structured, auditable artefacts

### Explicitly out of scope
- Autonomous parameter updates
- Self-ratification of proposed changes
- Changes to evaluation metrics or invariants
- Online or real-time parameter adaptation

---

## 3. Architectural Placement

Parameter suggestions are generated by the **Challenger** component.

They are **not** produced by:
- the optimiser / policy selector
- the evaluator
- the environment

This preserves the following role separation:

| Component   | Responsibility |
|------------|----------------|
| Optimiser  | Act under fixed parameters |
| Evaluator  | Measure performance under invariant criteria |
| Challenger | Critique behaviour and propose improvements |
| Authority  | Decide whether to accept or reject proposals |

---

## 4. Output Contract

When enabled, the Challenger MAY emit an additional output field:

```
"proposed_parameter_changes": [
  {
    "parameter": "<name>",
    "direction": "<increase | decrease | increase_slightly | decrease_slightly>",
    "suggested_values": [<candidate values>],
    "reason": "<evidence-based explanation>"
  }
]
```

### Properties
- Suggestions are non-binding
- Suggested values are bounded and discrete
- Each proposal includes an explicit justification

---

## 5. Evidence Requirements

Parameter suggestions MUST be grounded in observable strain signals, such as:

- Increasing regret slope
- High or unstable switching rates
- Slow post-drift recovery
- Divergence between reward and stability metrics

Suggestions MUST NOT be:
- speculative
- goal-driven
- framed as optimal or necessary

They are hypotheses, not decisions.

---

## 6. Example Heuristics (Non-Normative)

### Over-exploration
- Signal:
  - High switching variance
  - Increasing regret slope despite high exploration
- Suggestion:
  - Decrease `iai_gamma` or `epsilon`

### Under-exploration
- Signal:
  - Slow recovery after drift
  - Low switching with rising regret
- Suggestion:
  - Increase `iai_gamma` or `epsilon`

### Instability without collapse
- Signal:
  - Oscillatory behaviour without catastrophic failure
- Suggestion:
  - Narrow exploration range rather than aggressive change

---

## 7. Authority and Ratification

All parameter suggestions require **external ratification**.

The system itself:
- does not apply changes
- does not re-evaluate itself under modified parameters
- does not assume acceptance

A typical ratification workflow includes:
1. Challenger emits suggestion with evidence
2. External authority reviews proposal
3. Authority decides:
   - accept
   - reject
   - defer
4. If accepted, a new run is executed under updated parameters
5. Results are compared under the same invariant criteria

---

## 8. Safety Guarantees

This extension preserves all IAI safety properties:

- No self-sovereignty
- No metric gaming
- No hidden optimisation of evaluation criteria
- Full auditability of change proposals

Parameter suggestion does not constitute self-modification.
It constitutes **structured self-critique**.

---

## 9. Relationship to Recursive Improvement

This mechanism enables a bounded form of recursive improvement:

- The system improves how it optimises
- Not what it optimises
- Not how success is defined

Recursive improvement remains:
- externally anchored
- discontinuous
- explicitly authorised

---

## 10. Design Intent

This extension exists to demonstrate that an intelligent system can:

recognise when its own behaviour is sub-optimal  
articulate evidence-based improvement directions  
and refrain from acting without permission

This is a core capability of Invariant-Anchored Intelligence.
